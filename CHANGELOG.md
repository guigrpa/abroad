- **Server + client**:
  - Add delete-unused-messages feature.

## 4.0.0 (2020-12-14)

- **Server**:
  - Remove unused `uiBase` config option.
  - **Bugfix**: handle directory access errors while source parsing.
- **Client**:
  - Fix translation column header tooltip.

## 4.0.0-rc.0 (2020-12-13)

Reimplemented the whole thing from scratch, with the following goals in mind:

- Ballast dropping. Several technologies have been dropped since they are not needed for a small application like this (GraphQL, Relay, WebSockets). Some features have also been dropped since we really do not have the bandwidth to maintain them and were not being used (React Intl). Others were really unnecessary, e.g. the capability to edit the configuration from the UI -- this can be done directly by editing the config file.

- Performance improvements. The client slowed to a crawl when the number of messages to be translated was above 500-600, due to inefficient React components. Mady v4 uses Giu's DataTable component, which renders only the rows being displayed. The result is a whopping 15x decrease in load time for 650 messages and 2 translation languages.

- Flexibility. The new decomposition in 4 packages (`mady`, `mady-server`, `mady-client` and `mady-client-components`) makes it possible to:

  - Configure `mady` as production dependency, and `mady-server` as development dependency, cleaning up your dependency tree.
  - Embed Mady's client in another tool (using `mady-client-components`)
  - Include Mady's API endpoints in another API (using `mady-server`'s Express-compatible `serverPlugin`).

**Migration guide:**

- Runtime library (`mady` package): fully backwards-compatible. Basic usage remains the same, with the only exception being loading the `_t` helper from the `mady` library:

```js
// Before
const _t = require('mady');

// After
const _t = require('mady').default;

// If you already imported mady this way, you need to do nothing:
import _t from 'mady';
```

- Translations tool (`mady-server` package): 99% backwards-compatible. You just need to add `mady-server` to your `devDependencies`. The executable is the same (`mady`), so your npm scripts should run just fine.

## 3.4.0 (2020-1-17)

- **Server**:

## 3.0.3 (2018-11-14)

## 3.0.2 (2018-11-14)

- Replace uglify-js with Terser (better-maintained).

## 3.0.1 (2018-11-14)

## 3.0.0 (2018-11-14)

- **General**:
  - Add the possibility to request an auto-translation from the server.

  - Server plugin: accept `onChange` option, a function that is called whenever locales are compiled.
  - Server plugin: make it compatible with a user that already uses websockets.
- **Client**:
  - Set a maximum row height (except when selected).

## 2.13.0 (2018-10-11)

- Server plugin: accept `otherLocaleDirs` (same as the `--other-dirs` flag described below).

## 2.12.0 (2018-7-20)

- Add `--other-dirs` CLI flag (allows you to include keys and translations from the libs you use in your application, as long as those libs are also using Mady).

## 2.11.1 (2018-3-15)

- Fix Firefox layout.

## 2.11.0 (2018-3-15)

- Add some theming support via URL querystring (try `?theme=bw`).

## 2.10.3 (2018-2-28)

## 2.10.2 (2018-2-28)

## 2.10.1 (2018-2-28)

## 2.10.0 (2018-2-28)

- Add experimental interface to integrate the Mady server in another Express.js server (`lib/serverPlugin`).

## 2.9.0 (2018-2-21)

- Add support for a `getExtraMessages.js` hook (in the locale directory), which allows injecting messages in Mady that do not appear in the source files.
- Add support for **Markdown** messages and translations (‚â† MessageFormat messages).
- Add support for **scoped** messages, which produce separate JS output modules (translations are stored in JSON files as always, along with the unscoped message translations).

## 2.8.0 (2017-10-23)

- Remove translations from compiled files if the corresponding key no longer exists or is unused.
- Replace cmd-A shortcut (filter removal) with cmd-shift-A, which causes fewer UX issues.
- Add `originalLang` config option to prevent automatic translations for original language. For the time being, this option can only be modified at the server side.

## 2.7.2, 2.7.3 (2017-8-22)

- Bugfix: fetch automatic translations also when a new language is added (disabled accidentally).

## 2.7.1 (2017-8-22)

- Bugfix: Fix strange behaviour in Production after 3 different key selections ‚Äî remove `relay-query-lookup-renderer` and SSR (for the time being).

## 2.7.0 (2017-8-22)

- Generate **automatic translations** whenever new messages or languages are added to the database. All automatic translations are automatically flagged as dubious.

## 2.6.0 (2017-8-20)

- Add **watch-based (or _delta_) parsing**: Mady now automatically parses files that are added, changed or removed from your watched folders, and then pushes changes in real time to all connected users. This increases parse times a lot and aims at improving developer workflows.

## 2.5.1 (2017-8-19)

- Fix SSR.

## 2.5.0 (2017-8-19)

- **Multi-user support**: changes by one user are automatically pushed to other users.
- Bugfix: correct handling of keyboard shortcuts in filters (caused by an upstream bug).

## 2.4.0 (July 25, 2017)

- **Add filters**: untranslated or unused messages, fuzzy translations.
- **Performance improvements**.

## 2.3.1 (May 3, 2017)

- Fix missing `buffer` dependency.

## 2.3.0 (May 2, 2017)

- Add React Native compatibility (#9).

## 2.2.0 (March 16, 2017)

- **Flag translations as dubious**.
- Allow selection of message keys.
- Improve usability of Translation help (float instead of inline; hide on hover).

## 2.1.0 (February 2, 2017)

- [Internal] Now built with Webpack 2

## 2.0.0 (October 7, 2016)

- **(Minor) breaking change**: Mady no longer looks for a `.madyrc` file at your project root. This file only contained two parameters (the rest of Mady's configuration being stored in the `<locales>/config.json` file): a port number (which for Mady's purposes is not so important) and the relative path to the locales folder. The relative path should now be passed in with the CLI `--dir` argument, instead of via `.madyrc`.

- [M] **Add [React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) integration**:
  - If Mady finds the babel-core and babel-plugin-react-intl modules (included as `peerDependencies`), it will automatically enable the React Intl integration and extract messages from your `FormattedMessage`/`FormattedHTMLMessage` components and `defineMessages()` calls, as supported by the Babel plugin.
  - Add support for React Intl's `description` field, used to give more context to the translator than the message prefix (e.g. `someContext_A message`)
  - Translation compilation now generates `${lang}.reactIntl.json` files that you can use to bootstrap React Intl
- [M] **Add custom regexp parsing** (#6)
- [M] **Add generic JSON output format**, useful for some integrations (#6)

## 1.6.1 (August 25, 2016)

- [m] Automatically open Mady's webpage when the server starts
- [m] Bugfix: prevent click on "copy key" button from getting lost when the user is editing another translation.

## 1.6.0 (August 18, 2016)

- [m] Add `_t.addLocales(lang, locales)` function and `_t.setLocales(lang)` signature: Mady can now keep track of all locales and use parent BCP47 codes when the requested BCP47 is not available.
- [m] Add `_t.addLocaleCode(lang, localeCode)` and `_t.getLocaleCode(desiredLang)` (returning { lang, result }, where the returned `lang` isn't necessarily the same as `desiredLang`). These two are useful for bootstrapping locale code.

## 1.5.0 (August 16, 2016)

- [M] Better **BCP47** support: complete missing translations with those from descendants and ancestors.
  - If you define your languages as `['en-US', 'es']`, you'll get _three_ JS files, not two: `en`, `en-US` and `es`.
  - If you define translations for `en`, `en-US` will inherit them, plus the specific `en-US` translations.
  - Translations for a sub-language (e.g. `es-ES`) will flow up to the parent language if it doesn't have a translation for that key. What's more, those translations will also flow down to other sub-languages (e.g. `es-MX`) if the key is missing.

## 1.4.0 (August 1, 2016)

- [M] Allow **Unicode escape sequences** in keys and translations (i.e. emojis, and non-English messages!! -- translations were fine already).
  You can now translate üëç (en) as üëè (es-ES) and then üíÉ (es-ES-andalusia)
- [M] **Automatic migration** from older DB versions.
- [M] **Add `--recompile` option** to CLI.
- [m] Bug: Fix a case in which removing an item from a list in the settings dialogue also removes the following ones.
- [m] Get the parse icon to spin again.

## 1.3.1 (July 23, 2016)

- [m] Exclude .babelrc from NPM package
- [m] Bump dependencies

## 1.3.0 (June 2, 2016)

- [M] **Allow configuration of the message translation functions** (markers for message extraction).
- [M] **Support extraction of multi-line messages** (especially useful for complex MessageFormat strings with nested plurals and selections).
- Update docs.
- Deps: bump `graphql@0.6.0`, `react-relay@0.9.0` (+ related).
- Store sources always with slashes (not with backward-slashes in Windows).
- **Bugfix**: Details: correct variable usage (add namespace to selectedKeyId prop, to avoid overlap with Relay variable).
- Add thank-you note to readme.

## 1.2.1 (May 26, 2016)

- Fix SSR in production (bad relative paths).

## 1.2.0 (May 26, 2016)

- [M] Add server-side rendering (SSR)
- Show user notifications upon mutation errors.
- Use promises for all mutations.
- Add optimistic responses for delete and create mutations.
- **Bugfix**: fix Storyboard config.

## 1.1.0 (May 22, 2016)

- [M] Migrate to [Giu](https://github.com/guigrpa/giu) v0.4.x.
- [M] **Add hint screen**.
- Can now press alt-return to commit translation.
- Back end: compilation now happens synchronously rather than asynchronously whenever the DB changes, as part of the mutation.

## 1.0.4 (May 2, 2016)

- [M] **Use [Giu](https://github.com/guigrpa/giu) for all components**.
- **Fix #1**: Badly formatted translations crash the server process.

## 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3 (Apr. 20, 2016)

- Fix production dependencies and config.
- [m] Remove columns for languages missing from config.

## 1.0.0 (Apr. 20, 2016)

- Semver
- [M] **Simpler translation edit** operations: click to edit, click outside to save, ESC to revert changes.
- [M] **Textareas instead of text inputs**, allowing multiline translation fields. Very, very customised textareas.
- [M] Basic message and language **statistics**.
- [M] **Autocompile**, whenever something changes -- never again forget the compilation step.
- [m] Don't highlight missing translations of _unused_ keys.

## 0.1.6 (Apr. 18, 2016)

- [M] **Use mady on mady itself (i18n'd!)**.
- [m] Add spinner while parsing.
- [m] Lots of UX details.

## 0.1.5 (Apr. 16, 2016)

- First public release.
