# Mady [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mady.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mady)

An easy-to-use tool to manage and translate ICU MessageFormat messages.

![Mady UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/mady/master/docs/01-ui.png)

*Yes, it's Mady's view of herself!* :open_mouth: For more details on the MessageFormat syntax (*hamburger* examples above), see the [MessageFormat guide](https://messageformat.github.io/guide/):

```js
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers}}", { NUM: 1 }));
// 1 hamburguesa
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers}}", { NUM: 2 }));
// 2 hamburguesas
```

Remember: this is not only for translation! Even if you only use English, you may need MessageFormat for gender, pluralisation and even regionalisation (*regionalization*).

## Why?

* **Easy-to-use tool for parsing source files, editing translations, comparing languages side-by-side, filtering missing/dubious/unused translations, and compiling to (optionally minified) JavaScript modules**.
* A **translation function** to run the compiled language modules.
* **[React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) interoperability**, both for message extraction and translation injection.
* **Multi-user support**: multiple users can work simultaneously, with changes pushed in real time to all of them.
* **Automatic translations**: Mady suggests automatic translations as soon as new messages or languages are added to its database.
* **Ultra-fast parsing**: Mady watches your application folders and parses files as they are added, changed or deleted, then pushes all changes to the connected users. No more waiting for the parsing spinner to stop!
* **MessageFormat messages**: while it does not solve all the problems in the huge field of i18n, MessageFormat is a much more powerful tool than the conventional gettext (IMHO).
* **Full UNICODE support**: messages and translations can include any UNICODE character. In other words, you can now translate üëç (en) as üëè (es-ES) and then üíÉ (es-ES-andalusia)!
* **BCP47 support and locale inheritance**: fetch missing translations from parent/child languages or dialects, and even sibling languages (other regions) as a last resort.
* **Dubious translations**: flag some translations to revisit them later on.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save mady
```

If you use [React Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl), make sure you also install the following packages so that Mady can parse your React Intl components:

```
$ npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-intl babel-core
```

Then add the following line to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "translate": "mady"
}
```

or, if you want to store your locales in a specific folder (default: `<project root>/locales`):

```json
"scripts": {
    "translate": "mady --dir path/to/locales"
}
```


## Usage

There are two main parts in Mady: the web-based translation app and the translation function. The webapp is only needed during development (for the extraction, translation and management of messages and translations), whereas the translation function can be used in your own application, and hence in production as well.


### The translation app

Access the translation app by running `npm run translate`. Mady will automatically launch in your default browser (default URL: http://localhost:8080). From the web application, you can:

* Update the message database with new messages extracted from your source files
* Configure your languages, source paths, file extensions, etc.
* Mark translations as dubious
* Translate your keys to the different supported languages
* Apply filters: untranslated or unused messages, dubious translations, etc.
* [Automatically] export translations to JS files and other formats, for use by the [translation function](#the-translation-function), React Intl and other integrations

Messages in your source files might have the form: `_t('someContext_Once upon a time...')` (single or double quotes are supported), where `_t()` is the default name for the translation function (see below), `someContext` is some hint for the translator and `Once upon a time...` is your untranslated [MessageFormat](#messageformat) message.

Mady can also extract messages from React Intl components out of the box. Or you can specify your own regex patterns in the UI.

Configuration looks like this:

![Mady config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/mady/master/docs/02-config.png)

You can see the UI in English, Spanish and Catalan at the moment. Mady *eats her own dog food*.


### The translation function

Using the translation function is similarly straightforward:

```js
import _t from 'mady';
import locales from './locales/es';

_t.setLocales(locales);

console.log(_t('someContext_Once upon a time...'));
// √ârase una vez...
console.log(_t('someContext_Number of items: {NUM}', { NUM: 5 }));
// N√∫mero de √≠tems: 5
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers} }", { NUM: 1 }));
// 1 hamburguesa
console.log(_t("someContext_{NUM, plural, one{1 hamburger} other{# hamburgers} }", { NUM: 2 }));
// 2 hamburguesas
```

Alternatively, you can set up locales beforehand and then activate one or the other. In case the requested variant is not available, its closest BCP47 parent is enabled:

```js
import _t from 'mady';
import locales from './locales/es';

_t.addLocales('es', locales);
const lang = _t.setLocales('es-US');
// returns 'es', since we don't have the American Spanish variant

const lang = _t.setLocales('fr');
// does nothing, since we have no French translations
```


## BCP47 and translation fallbacks

Mady "fills in the gaps" when **building** translation modules (`{lang.js}`) and React Intl message bundles (`{lang}.reactIntl.json`). In other words, when you don't provide a translation for message X for a particular language (e.g. `es-ES`), it will look for suitable fallback translations in related languages:

* Parent languages (e.g. `es`)
* Sibling languages (e.g. `es-MX`)
* Children languages (e.g. `es-ES-andalusia`)

If you use Mady's translation function and it cannot find a suitable translation, it will just take the message key (e.g. `someContext_Untranslated message`), remove the context prefix and use it as a last-resort fallback.


## The locales folder

You can find the following files in the locales folder (`./locales` by default):

* A configuration file: `config.json`
* A message file: `keys.json`
* A raw translation file per language, e.g. `fr.json` (this is the one you edit with the web application)
* Several output files per language, depending on your configuration: a compiled translation module (`fr.js`), a message bundle for React Intl (e.g. `fr.reactIntl.json`), or a generic JSON file (e.g. `fr.out.json`). All of these files are generated automatically.


## MessageFormat

Mady uses the [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js) library by Alex Sexton, which "supports and extends all parts of the **ICU MessageFormat** standard (see the [user guide](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages)), with the exception of the deprecated ChoiceFormat." IMHO, and while it does not solve all the problems in the huge field of i18n, it is a much more powerful tool than the conventional gettext.

Some examples of MessageFormat messages are given above ([more here](https://messageformat.github.io/guide/)), but this does not even scratch the surface of what is enabled by this standard.


## Internals

Mady is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), and is fully server-side-rendered. It was built as a proof-of-concept for the latest web technologies.

## Why *Mady*?

This library is named after my cousin, a brilliant person with an extraordinary talent for languages. I thank her for teaching me English when I was a little child.
